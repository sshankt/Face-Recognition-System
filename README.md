## 📖 Introduction
The Face Recognition Attendance System is a real-time application that utilizes face recognition technology to track attendance automatically. It captures video input, recognizes faces from a pre-defined list of students, and logs their attendance in a CSV file. This project enhances efficiency in attendance management and reduces manual errors.

## 🚀 Features
Real-time face recognition using a webcam.
Attendance logging in a CSV format with timestamps.
User-friendly interface displaying recognized names.
Capability to manage multiple known faces.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Face Recognition (face_recognition library)
NumPy
CSV
datetime
📥 Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

``` bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git
cd face-recognition-attendance
Install Required Packages: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries:
```
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy
Prepare Face Images: Create a directory named faces and add images of known individuals you want to recognize, named appropriately (e.g., shashank.jpg, harry.png).

🏁 Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python attendance.py
The webcam will activate, and the program will start recognizing faces.

When a recognized face is detected, it will display the name along with a "Present" message on the video feed.

The attendance will be logged in a CSV file named after the current date.

## 📝 Code Explanation
The program captures video input using OpenCV.
It loads known face encodings from image files.
For each frame captured, it detects faces and compares them with the known encodings.
If a match is found, the student's name is displayed and logged in a CSV file.

## 🔑 Key Components
Face Recognition: Utilizes face_recognition library for detecting and encoding faces.
Attendance Logging: Logs the name and time of presence in a CSV file.
Real-time Video Capture: Uses OpenCV to display the video feed and recognize faces.
